# Roadmap (v0.0 → v0.2)

## v0.0 — Climate + Ecology

* Deterministic climate belts → biome classification.
* Ecology kernel nudges water/soil toward biome targets and emits drought/flood highlights.
* NDJSON streaming (`simd`) and batch runner (`simstep`).
* Golden run for `wet_equator` seed checked in under `testdata/golden`.

## v0.1 — Evolution scaffolding

* Expand world state with proto-species populations.
* Introduce `evolution` kernel reading from climate/ecology output.
* Extend chronicle with basic evolutionary beats.
* Viewer overlays for species richness.

## v0.2 — Cognition previews

* Add cognition placeholders with stress/ritual cause codes.
* Time-series buffering in viewer (120 frame ring).
* Preliminary institution hooks for later milestones.
